                    <p id="topic-phrase">"...your very existence is aginst the law..."</p>
                    <p>Describes the experience of being born into a society where your very existence is against the
                        law
                        and
                        seen
                        as a threat to the rules that uphold injustice. As Trevor Noah, the first moment of his life was
                        forced
                        to
                        live in hiding, to be cautious, and to fight for his right to simply exist. He was considered
                        "illegally
                        alive" because, under South Africa's apartheid laws, relationships between black and white
                        people
                        were
                        illegal, and children born from such uniions were not supposed to exist. His life was a crime
                        not
                        because of
                        what he did , but because of who he was.</p>

                    <p>The quote from Born a Crime "Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he
                        never
                        fell
                        in love with subservient women..'He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put
                        her in a
                        cage.'"powerfully reveals a disturbing truth about certain relationship dynamics, loving someone
                        for
                        their
                        strength while secretly wanting to break that strength and controling them.<br><br>
                        Abel is drawn to Patricia because of her independence, intelligence, and strong will. She defies
                        the
                        system,
                        raises her son alone, and builds a life with her own hands, which was not expected and allowed
                        in Abel's
                        culture. This contradiction still happens in many relationships today. </p>

                Society often praises
                        strong and
                        empowered woman, but in practice, some men feel threatened by that strength to control it. I
                        have seen
                        women
                        who are confident and successful are admired at first, but later pressured to give up their
                        careers and
                        dreams to fit a more traditional role.
            Even celebrities like Michelle Obama have faced criticism
            for
            being
            too outspoken as a wife, showing how society still struggles with powerful woman. <br><br>
            This quote mentions the tension between gender roles and personal expectations. Abel wants a
            traditional
            wife, obedient, quiet and dependent, but he falls in love with a woman who is none of those
            things. His
            love
            becomes violent, not because Patricia changes, but because he can't control her. This reflects a
            wider
            issue
            where some relationships are built on power rather than partnership. Some men thinks women are
            naturally
            under men's power. For that they want to control and show them their power. They don't want them
            to use
            their brain, to communicate and share their ideas with anyone. They just want them to do house
            chores
            and
            raise their kids. </br> </p>
